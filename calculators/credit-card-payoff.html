  <h2>How Credit Card Interest Adds Up</h2>
  <p>
    Credit card interest is calculated daily based on your balance and APR (Annual Percentage Rate). If you carry a balance from month to month, interest charges can grow rapidly — making it harder to pay off your debt.
  </p><p></p>
  <p>
    Our calculator helps you see how long it will take to pay off your balance, and how much interest you’ll pay based on your current monthly payment.
  </p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Balance: $5,000</li>
    <li>APR: 22%</li>
    <li>Monthly Payment: $150</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At that rate, it would take over 5 years to pay off — and you’d pay thousands in interest. By increasing your monthly payment even slightly, you can dramatically reduce both time and interest.
  </p>
  <h3>Tip:</h3>
  <p>
    Try adjusting your monthly payment in the calculator to see how even a small change affects your total interest. You’ll quickly see the power of paying more than the minimum.
  </p>
  <h2>Understanding the Cost of Credit Card Debt</h2>
<p>
  The average American carries several thousand dollars in credit card debt — and many don’t realize just how much of their payment goes toward interest. When your APR is high, your monthly payments may barely touch the principal.
</p>
<p>
  This is why credit card companies love minimum payments: they keep you in debt longer, collecting interest. But the good news is that every extra dollar you pay above the minimum goes entirely toward reducing your balance.
</p>
<p>
  ClearCalc helps you visualize the long-term impact of your decisions — whether it’s boosting your monthly payment, refinancing to a lower interest card, or just committing to a payoff plan.
</p>
<p>
  Knowledge is power. Play around with the numbers and find a plan that works for you.
